dont want to download and delete the same dataset again and again.
would make sense to have it as part of the make file i guess

also a script file would be nice, which can be configured to download different datasets

to download datasets execute the following command from project directory

```bash
./scripts/download_datasets {DATASET}
```

check the script for available datasets

the downloaded datasets are in {PROJECT_DIR}/{DATASET}
