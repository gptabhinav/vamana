## Downloading Datasets

To avoid repeatedly downloading and deleting the same dataset, use this instead.

A configurable script is available for downloading different datasets.

### Usage

To download a dataset, run the following command from the project directory:

```bash
./scripts/download_datasets {DATASET}
```

Check the script for a list of available datasets.

Downloaded datasets are stored in `{PROJECT_DIR}/{DATASET}`.
